Binaries for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit ugrep.exe are included in the
repository: building ugrep on Windows takes some serious effort to install and
compile PCRE2 and all of the compression libraries together with ugrep with the
proper configuration settings of C++ dev tools.

Visual Studio ugrep.exe build instructions can be found in vs/ugrep/README.txt
